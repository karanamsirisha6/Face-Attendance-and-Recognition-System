# Face-Attendance-and-Recognition-System

A face recognition-based attendance system developed using Python, the face recognition library, and webcam integration. This system processes and converts webcam feeds for accurate recognition and display of faces, thereby automating attendance management.

## Features

- Face Recognition: Utilizes a face recognition library to identify and verify faces.
- Webcam Integration: Captures real-time video feed from a webcam.
- Color Conversion: Converts color formats for accurate image processing.
- Image Processing: Enhances image quality and recognition accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Additional Dependencies: Ensure you have a working webcam and the required drivers installed on your system.

## How It Works

1. Webcam Feed: The system captures video input from the webcam.
2. Color Conversion: Converts the color format of the captured images for better processing.
3. Face Recognition: Detects and identifies faces from the processed images.
4. Attendance Logging: Marks the attendance of recognized faces.

## Project Structure

 - main.py: The main script to run the attendance system.
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies required for the project.
- README.md: Project documentation.

## Future Enhancements

- Database Integration: Save attendance logs to a database.
- GUI Development: Develop a user-friendly graphical interface.
- Enhanced Security: Improve the accuracy and security of the face recognition process.
